Regular Expressions
Author: Michael Reed
Year: 2011

This is source code for a regular expression library in C. At the moment it's just a side project, but I hope to make it good enough for other people to use should anyone want to. My engine uses the Thompson NFA model to represent a regex and match it against strings. It supports capture groups, bracketed character classes (no shortcuts yet), the standard quantifiers (+, *, ?), the '.' wildcard operator, and negation of literals and character classes using '~'. At present, the search algorithm for matches uses a breadth first search on the states of the nfa.
